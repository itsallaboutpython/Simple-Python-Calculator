# Python-Nice-Looking-Calculator
A nice looking python calculator app made from tkinter

## Features
### 1. Nice looking color interface
=> It has a nice color interface giving a light and unique look\
=> It consists of 4 themes: 'Light', 'Dark', 'Default', and 'Default-opposite'\
=> User can start the calculator by giving appropriate command\
`python main.py -t light`\
=> For now, anyone can download the files and change colors by changing values of "OUTPUT_BG" and "BUTTON_BG" from main.py code

### 2. Button and Textbox ratio is maintained
=> All the buttons acquire 3/4th and textbox acquires 1/4th of total window size\
=> The ratio remains constant irrespective of the size of the window\
=> The window can be resized easily while maintaining above ratio

### 3. Keyboard binding
=> Apart from clicking buttons to enter numbers and operators (ex "+", "-" etc..), keyboard binding is also implemented\
=> User can enter values by using keyboard bindings alone\
=> keyboard bindings are as follows:
  1. Number keys - from 0 to 9
  2. Operator keys:
     1. "+" key for addition
     2. "-" key for substraction
     3. "*" or "x" key for multiplication
     4. "/" key for division
     5. "=" and "enter" key for answer
     6. "backspace" key to delete single character
     7. "delete" key to clear textbox
     8. "escape" key to exit program

### 4. Object Oriented Programming implemented
=> The main.py file contains a class for Calculator app\
=> If someone wants to integrate a calculator in their tkinter app, they can directly get the file and import the class for ease of use
